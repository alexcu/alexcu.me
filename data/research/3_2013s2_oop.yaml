abstract: >
  Model-View-Controller decouples abstracted classifications from any form of
  their representation and interaction by use of Observer and Mediator design
  patterns. However, do developers sacrifice performance for these complex
  designs? If performance is affected when classes are mediated by a Controller,
  or coupled when not, is this also the case when the language changes? By
  implementing simple systems that reflected decoupled and coupled designs in
  two different languages, it was found that performance generally improves in
  coupled designs, albeit with some variations depending on language and metric.
  Results emphasised that coupled designs may be viable when efficiency is
  paramount, although the benefits of flexibility and modularity are certainly
  forgone by doing so.
