  Text detection in natural images is a growing area with increasing applications, including traffic sign and license plate recognition, and text-based image search. Robustly detecting and recognising text is especially challenging when text is deformed, such as the photometric and geometric distortions of text worn by a moving subject in unstructured scenes. Existing methods of text detection in such cases are classified as learning-based or connected component (CC)-based, applying a mix of enhanced detection techniques—such as stroke width transformation (SWT), canny-edge detection and maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs)— and feeding candidates into optical character recognition (OCR) engines or neural networks to recognise the text. This study proposes applying a learning-based approach using deeplearning strategies and transfer learning to automate the recognition of racing bib numbers (RBNs) in a natural image dataset of different marathons, with the intention to then rank the subject’s photos in order of prominence. Experimental results showed that these deeplearning strategies performed favourably, with RBN detection accuracy beyond 95%. This prompts further investigation in the generality of the technique developed to other similar subject material.
