  Learning programming for problem-solving purposes allow for programming
  concepts to solve problems via a variety of different tools, or programming
  languages. However, what happens when one familiar tool is replaced with
  anotherâ€”if the problem is familiar and easily solvable with one tool, is
  this the case with another? By observing an intermediate programmer's ability
  to learn, it was found that if these concepts are well known, adapting them
  to another language is not difficult. A survey, which measured the
  participant's confidence in the language afterwards, suggested that most
  programmers themselves find little difficulty in learning a language,
  emphasising that languages are not as difficult to learn as some think to be.
