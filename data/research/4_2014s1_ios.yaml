  Mobile platforms today have changed more in the last five years than since
  the dawn of mobile devices. The success of major mobile platforms today can
  be attributed to their revolutionary UIs that shifted traditional HCI with
  new HCI. What is it about the design that makes these platforms successful?
  Do different major platforms differ in their implementation of HCI, and how
  does this change the user experience between them? On inspection of design
  guidelines and critical differential analysis popular apps between the iOS
  and Android platforms, it was found that iOS has a greater focus on content,
  while Android keeps its user's needs paramount. A good UI on iOS is considered
  clean, non-competitive with content and largely should play a supporting role
  to the content. That of Android is more emotionally involved with the user,
  provides features that aids users more and allows greater customisability
  options. Ultimately, the user experience is similar between the two, but the
  subtle differences in the respective design principles are just enough to
  change what the focus of the HCI is between varying platforms.
