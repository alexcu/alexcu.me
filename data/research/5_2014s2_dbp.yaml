  Database programmers have a variety of tools at their fingertips. Which of
  these tools provide the greatest operability and flexibility? How well do
  these tools operate with high loads of data, and is there an adverse affect
  to performance for the sake of greater ease of programming? What kinds of
  queries on the database perform better than others? By developing a simple
  database testing tool over MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDb DBMSs, differently
  sized datasets were tested under different query patterns, which demonstrated
  poor performance and operability with MongoDb against MySQL or PostgreSQL,
  though ORM for MySQL and PostgreSQL tended to perform better than raw SQL
  queries. However, such a varied distribution of results concluded that
  performance will vary over dataset size.
