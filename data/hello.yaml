  I'm Alex, a 20-something Software Engineer from (sunny?) [Melbourne, Australia](http://wikipedia.org/en/Melbourne). I currently study Computer Science at [Swinburne University](http://swin.edu.au/).

  When I'm not hacking away at on [Doubtfire](http://github.com/doubtfire-lms), you can find me hiking outdoors, reading up the latest tech, or out saving 80s and 90s Macs from certain destruction!
