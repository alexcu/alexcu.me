  **I'm Alex, a 20-something Software Engineer from (sunny?) [Melbourne, Australia](http://wikipedia.org/en/Melbourne). I currently study Computer Science at [Swinburne University](http://swin.edu.au/).**

  When I'm not hacking away at [SSIL](http://ssil.com.au), you can find me hiking outdoors, reading up the latest tech, or out saving 80s and 90s Macs from certain destruction!
