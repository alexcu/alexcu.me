  I'm Alex, a full-stack software engineer from [Melbourne, Australia](http://wikipedia.org/en/Melbourne). I currently work under the [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>)](https://www.deakin.edu.au/a2i2) as a research software engineer.

  With industry experience in the education, research and commercial sectors, I have worked on writing and deploying iOS and large-scale web applications, low-level SDKs with C/C++, and machine learning data processing with Python. At A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>, I've been actively involved in R&D projects exploring an <a href="http://deakin.edu.au/~ca/alphanum">AI-based alphanumeric identification system</a> and building a surrounding end-to-end data engineering pipeline. Currently, I am pursuing a research doctorate in operationalising AI using software engineering practices for AI in business use.

  I'm passionate about teaching programming as practically as possible, and have been doing so since 2014. I also love open source software and contribute to several open source projects in [computer science education](http://github.com/splashkit) and [higher education learning](http://github.com/doubtfire-lms). I also previously worked as a resident tutor of software engineering at [International House](http://ihouse.unimelb.edu.au/), a college of the [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au/).

  When I'm not busy coding, you can find me hiking outdoors, reading up the latest tech, or out saving 80s and 90s Macs from certain destruction!
