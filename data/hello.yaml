  I'm Alex, an AI-focused research software engineer from [Melbourne, Australia](http://wikipedia.org/en/Melbourne). I currently work under the [Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://www.deakin.edu.au/a2i2) (A&sup2;I&sup2;) as an associate research fellow.

  With industry experience in the education, research and commercial sectors, I have worked on writing and deploying iOS and large-scale web applications, low-level SDKs with C/C++, and machine learning data processing with Python. At A&sup2;I&sup2;, I've been actively involved in R&D projects  such as building an <a href="http://deakin.edu.au/~ca/alphanum">AI-based alphanumeric identification system</a> and end-to-end data engineering pipelines. Currently, I am pursuing a research doctorate on improving software and AI integration for production systems.

  I'm passionate about teaching programming as practically as possible, and have been doing so since 2014. I also love open source software and contribute to several open source projects in [computer science education](https://splashkit.io) and [higher education learning](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms). I also previously worked as a resident tutor of software engineering at [International House](http://ihouse.unimelb.edu.au/), a college of the [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au/).

  When I'm not busy tech'ing, you can find me hiking outdoors or [restoring 80s and 90s Macintoshes](https://twitter.com/AlexCummaudo/status/1236044533156073472)!
