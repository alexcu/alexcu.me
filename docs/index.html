Nice to meet you...</h1></header><article><p>I&#39;m Alex, a full-stack software engineer from <a href="http://wikipedia.org/en/Melbourne">Melbourne, Australia</a>. I currently work under the <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/a2i2">Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>)</a> as a research software engineer.</p>

<p>With industry experience in the education, research and commercial sectors, I have worked on writing and deploying iOS and large-scale web applications, low-level SDKs with C/C++, and machine learning data processing with Python. At A<sup>2</sup>I<sup>2</sup>, I&#39;ve been actively involved in R&amp;D projects exploring an <a href="http://deakin.edu.au/~ca/alphanum">AI-based alphanumeric identification system</a> and building a surrounding end-to-end data engineering pipeline. Currently, I am pursuing a research doctorate in operationalising AI using software engineering practices for AI in business use.</p>

<p>I&#39;m passionate about teaching programming as practically as possible, and have been doing so since 2014. I also love open source software and contribute to several open source projects in <a href="http://github.com/splashkit">computer science education</a> and <a href="http://github.com/doubtfire-lms">higher education learning</a>. I also previously worked as a resident tutor of software engineering at <a href="http://ihouse.unimelb.edu.au/">International House</a>, a college of the <a href="http://unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>.</p>

<p>When I&#39;m not busy coding, you can find me hiking outdoors, reading up the latest tech, or out saving 80s and 90s Macs from certain destruction!</p>

Robustly detecting and recognising text is especially challenging when text is deformed, such as the photometric and geometric distortions of text worn by a moving subject in unstructured scenes. Existing methods of text detection in such cases are classified as learning-based or connected component (CC)-based, applying a mix of enhanced detection techniques—such as stroke width transformation (SWT), canny-edge detection and maximally stable extremal regions (MSERs)— and feeding candidates into optical character recognition (OCR) engines or neural networks to recognise the text. This study proposes applying a learning-based approach using deeplearning strategies and transfer learning to automate the recognition of racing bib numbers (RBNs) in a natural image dataset of different marathons, with the intention to then rank the subject’s photos in order of prominence. Experimental results showed that these deeplearning strategies performed favourably, with RBN detection accuracy beyond 95%. This prompts further investigation in the generality of the technique developed to other similar subject material.

However, what happens when one familiar tool is replaced with another—if the problem is familiar and easily solvable with one tool, is this the case with another? By observing an intermediate programmer's ability to learn, it was found that if these concepts are well known, adapting them to another language is not difficult. A survey, which measured the participant's confidence in the language afterwards, suggested that most programmers themselves find little difficulty in learning a language, emphasising that languages are not as difficult to learn as some think to be.

However, where does the balance lie for lowering the workload per thread and increasing the number of processing threads? Do limitations arise where an excessive amount of threads are used for parallel processing? What range exists for delegating an ideal amount of work to an ideal amount of threads for parallel processing? By developing a simple image processing program that makes use of concurrency utilities, parallel computation limitations were discovered, wherein advantages to reduced time where more parallel processing threads are used is worsened by having too many threads processing smaller and smaller pieces of data. Discussion into a heuristic for parallel tasks suggest ways in which this issue can be battled.

However, do developers sacrifice performance for these complex designs? If performance is affected when classes are mediated by a Controller, or coupled when not, is this also the case when the language changes? By implementing simple systems that reflected decoupled and coupled designs in two different languages, it was found that performance generally improves in coupled designs, albeit with some variations depending on language and metric. Results emphasised that coupled designs may be viable when efficiency is paramount, although the benefits of flexibility and modularity are certainly forgone by doing so.

The success of major mobile platforms today can be attributed to their revolutionary UIs that shifted traditional HCI with new HCI. What is it about the design that makes these platforms successful? Do different major platforms differ in their implementation of HCI, and how does this change the user experience between them? On inspection of design guidelines and critical differential analysis popular apps between the iOS and Android platforms, it was found that iOS has a greater focus on content, while Android keeps its user's needs paramount. A good UI on iOS is considered clean, non-competitive with content and largely should play a supporting role to the content. That of Android is more emotionally involved with the user, provides features that aids users more and allows greater customisability options. Ultimately, the user experience is similar between the two, but the subtle differences in the respective design principles are just enough to change what the focus of the HCI is between varying platforms.

Which of these tools provide the greatest operability and flexibility? How well do these tools operate with high loads of data, and is there an adverse affect to performance for the sake of greater ease of programming? What kinds of queries on the database perform better than others? By developing a simple database testing tool over MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDb DBMSs, differently sized datasets were tested under different query patterns, which demonstrated poor performance and operability with MongoDb against MySQL or PostgreSQL, though ORM for MySQL and PostgreSQL tended to perform better than raw SQL queries. However, such a varied distribution of results concluded that performance will vary over dataset size.
